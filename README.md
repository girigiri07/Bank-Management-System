# Bank Management System
A bank management system facilitates user registration, collecting essential data such as name, contact details, and account information. Users can perform debit and credit transactions, as well as transfers between accounts.

If a user already exists during registration, the system should display an error message prompting them to use a unique identifier. Upon successful registration and any subsequent debit or credit transactions, the system should send an email confirmation to the user.

Transaction entries should be displayed to users, providing a clear description of each transaction, including the date, amount, and transaction type. This enhances transparency and helps users keep track of their financial activities within the bank management system.
